# AccessBankLogo
Python code which draws Access Bank Logo

After being awarded the Adance Africa Scholarship to undergo the Udacity Intro to Programming course.
I decided to do a fun project to appreciate Access Bank, the sponsors of the Scholarship.
The project features one of the course outline which was using the Python Turtle Module to draw shapes and other exciting projects.
